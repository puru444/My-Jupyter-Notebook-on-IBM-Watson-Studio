I've been working in Technology sector from past 6 years and I have seen the relevance of data in making useful features in software products to increase revenue and growth.</i> \n    \n<i>Apart from commercial utility, DS also plays a key role in the field of Healthcare to create effective medicines and cures. I strongly believe that the DS is a stepping stone to move forward in Industrial Revolution 4.0 to advance new technologies like AI, Blockchain & Robotics. Therefore, its obvious to say that there are endless opportunities in career after mastering the DS study to start exploring the world of data because data is everywhere ...</i> \n    \n<i>On that positive note, I wish my fellow students Good Luck!! May you achieve your desired goals after completing this Certification to explore this deep ocean of data.</i>\n    \n<i>Thanks & Regards,</i>\n\n<i>Prateek Sharma</i>"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Below the code represents the function to add two integers (1+1):"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "1 + 1", "execution_count": 4, "outputs": [{"output_type": "execute_result", "execution_count": 4, "data": {"text/plain": "2"}, "metadata": {}}]}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "<b>1. Horizontal Rule in HTML.</b>\n\nTo make a horizontal line in HTML, use the < hr > element. We can also place the < hr > element \u2014 which stands for \u201chorizontal rule\u201d \u2014 wherever we want to create a horizontal line across a web page.\n\n<hr>\n\n<b>2. How to make Bulleted List in HTML?</b>\n\nHTML lists allow web developers to group a set of related items in lists. There are various types of lists have been used in HTML however there're mainly 2 types of lists have been used frequently:\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Ordered Lists</li>\n    <li>Unordered Lists</li>\n</ul>\n\n<b>Ordered List:</b> An ordered list also known as \"Numbered List\" starts with the < ol > tag. Each list item starts with the < li > tag. By putting < ol >, the list items will be marked with numbers by default.\n\nExample:\nThe first 4 months of any year comes in this order:\n <ol>\n  <li>January</li>\n  <li>February</li>\n  <li>March</li>\n  <li>April</li>\n</ol> \n\n<b>Unordered List:</b> An unordered list also known as \"Bulleted List\" starts with the < ul > tag. Each list item starts with the < li > tag. By putting < ul >, the list items will be marked with bullets (small black circles) by default.\n\nExample:\nThe 3 main products of Apple are:\n <ul>\n  <li>Macbook</li>\n  <li>iPad</li>\n  <li>iPhone</li>\n</ul> \n\n<hr>\n\n<b>3. Tables in HTML.</b>\n\nA table in HTML consists of table cells inside rows and columns. Where, following are the main attributes of table:\n\n<dl>\n  <dt>td tag</dt>\n  <dd>- Each table cell is defined by a < td > and a < /td > tag</dd>\n  <dd>- And, td stands for table data</dd>\n</dl>\n    \n<dl>  \n  <dt>tr tag</dt>\n  <dd>- Each table row starts with a < tr > and ends with a < /tr > tag.</dd>\n  <dd>- And, tr stands for table row</dd>\n</dl>   \n\n<dl>\n  <dt>th tags</dt>\n  <dd>- Sometimes we want our cells to be table header cells. In those cases we use the < th > tag instead of the < td > tag.</dd>\n  <dd>- And, th stands for table header. By default, the text in < th > elements are bold and centered, but yowe can change that with CSS. </dd>\n</dl>\n\nExample:\nCreate an employee table with Employee ID, Name, Age & Gender and create 3 sample records in this table:\n      \n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Employee ID</th>\n    <th>Name</th>\n    <th>Age</th>\n    <th>Gender</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>123</td>\n    <td>John</td>\n    <td>32</td>\n    <td>Male</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>124</td>\n    <td>Steve</td>\n    <td>25</td>\n    <td>Male</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>125</td>\n    <td>Maria</td>\n    <td>30</td>\n    <td>Female</td>\n</table> \n    \n<hr>"}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.10", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.10.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
